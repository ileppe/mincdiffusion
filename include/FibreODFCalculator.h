options: Behrens pdf, Tournier (DTI), Tounier (HARD), simple pricipal eigenvector, maybe deconvolving dODF with single fibre response (an estimated tensor): but why add that level of complexity?

1. Tournier (HARD)

assume b values sufficiently high

directional statistics, S2

obtain est. of single fibre response from a user-defined voxel (define using a binary minc file)

Tournier uses axially symmetric response function R(theta): can we assume axially symmetric?  How to use measured response function instead?

can use rat cord phantom to test the deconvolution
